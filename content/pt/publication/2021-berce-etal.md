abstract = "Wild boar (*Sus scrofa*) is one of the most damaging invasive  species in the world and can have a profound impact on the distribution  of native species. Nevertheless, there still are limitations on the  species’ current fine-scale spatial information, which is needed to  develop effective management measures. Here, we used Species  Distribution Models (SDMs) and niche overlap analysis to estimate  potential conflict areas between the wild boar and the native southern  pudu (*Pudu puda*), which is a bioindicator of the forest  conservation status within the Nahuel Huapi National Park (NHNP),  Argentina. The two species’ environmental niche overlaps by 40%, which  results in a wide geographical overlap between wild boar and pudu  distributions. The distribution model predicted that the wild boar  potential distribution occupies 22% of the national park and overlaps up to 67% with the pudu distribution, which in turn occupies 20% of the  park. Based on our models, we classified 12% of the park as extreme  management priority areas, because both species are present. High  priority areas, where wild boars have the potential to invade but will  not overlap with pudu populations, represent 10% of the park. Medium  priority areas, where wild boars do not threaten pudu populations, and  low priority areas, with no potential presence of either species, are 8% and 68%, respectively. The results of this study show how SDMs  developed at local scales can support the management and monitoring of  native and invasive species and help guide the allocation of efforts and resources for management actions focused on protected areas."
