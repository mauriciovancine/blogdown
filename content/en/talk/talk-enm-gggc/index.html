<p>The Ecological Niche Models (ENM) relate species occurrence data with their environmental conditions to estimate the species niche and thus predict new areas of possible distribution. In this lecture, I talked about the main concepts, input data and applications of this approach in the area of Ecology and performed a practice in R.</p>
