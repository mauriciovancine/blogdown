abstract = "This book contains 15 chapters ranging from how to download and install R, through data manipulation, diversity analysis, basic statistics, multidimensional methods, and geospatial data visualization. This is introductory material intended primarily for undergraduate and graduate students in ecology and related fields. We hope that it will be used both by those who want to delve into analyzes commonly used in ecology, and by those who have no or few quantitative skills. This book is one of the few, if not the only, material in Portuguese with this scope and aims to be the main entry manual for learning R and its applications in ecology, conservation and environmental sciences. For that, we propose a strategy that facilitates the choice of the statistical test, through the selection of clear questions/hypotheses and the connection of these hypotheses with the theory and the method. In addition, each chapter contains proposed exercises and their solutions, literature recommendations and specialized links to each chapter in the book, and a session on how to use the book in discussion groups and in the classroom."
