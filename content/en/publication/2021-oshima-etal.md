abstract = "Mammals are important components of biodiversity that have been  drastically and rapidly impacted by climate change, habitat loss, and  anthropogenic pressure. Understanding key species distribution to  optimize conservation targets is both urgent and necessary to reverse  the current biodiversity crisis. Herein, we applied habitat suitability  models for a key Neotropical forest ungulate, the white-lipped peccary  (WLP *Tayassu pecari*), to investigate the effects of climate and landscape modifications on its distribution, which has been drastically reduced in Brazil. We used 318 primary records of WLP to derive habitat suitability maps across Brazil. Our models included bioclimatic,  topographic, landscape, and human influence predictors in two modelling  approaches. Models including all categories of predictors obtained the  highest predictive ability and showed prevalence of suitable areas in  forested regions of the country, covering 49% of the Brazilian  territory. Filtering out small forest fragments (<2050 ha) reduced  the suitable area by 5%, with a further reduction of 4% that was caused  by deforestation until 2020, therefore until 2020, the species has  suffered a reduction of ~60% from its historical range in Brazil. Of the 40% of the Brazilian territory suitable to WLP, only 12% are protected. In the Atlantic Forest, only half of all protected areas have suitable  habitat for WLP and even less in Pantanal (44%), Cerrado (14%) and  Caatinga (7%). In a second modelling approach, mapping the areas with  suitable climate and those with suitable landscapes separately, allowed  us to identify four categories of conservation values, and showed that  only 17% of the Brazilian territory has both high landscape and climatic suitability for WLP. Our models can help with complementary  conservation management strategies and actions that could be essential  in slowing down and possibly reversing current trends of population and  geographic range reductions for te species, thereby averting a possible  future collapse of forest ecosystem functioning in the Neotropical  region."
